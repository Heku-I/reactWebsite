Trying to learn/improve on React by making a simple portfolio website. 

For some reson I get errors on the Footer1.jsx file, but cannot figure out why. Everything still works. 

TODO: 

1. Need to add links to other sites. 
2. Need to make the other sites, Home, Project, Contact. 
3. Need to fix the LinkedIn and Github Icon (not at the right spot). 
4. Try to add some effects with the profile picture. Thinking of something around it, also maybe eyes/face following the mouse?
